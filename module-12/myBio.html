                                I had stayed at K&amp;K for almost all four years of highschool and wanted to try another experience so I went to Target. Having had some experience with 3rd shift I had decided to come back and have since worked there another 2 years. In this job I have experience in Hardware,
                                Electrical, Plumbing, Tools, and Paint. I know the store in and out for almost all items. Any issue that has gone wrong in one of those departments I have had to come to a solution for either the customer or the store. The only thing I haven&#39;t done for the store is social media and even that might change soon.

                                While having played games for my entire life, I have gained a knack for technology and the mechanisms behind what drive them. With this drive I have been trying to learn coding languages pertaining to useful programs and games.
                                I currently have the most knowledge in Java and I enjoy how robust it is. Even if it can be a bit confusing at times, I really enjoy seeing how small changes can have big effects.
